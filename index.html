        <p class="text">
          Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,which can be
          interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some
          people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According
          to adventurer André Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is
          not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity? <br />
          <br />
          Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the
          purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing
          and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains
          in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the
          British adventurer Jason Lewis.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric
          wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
          of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
          forces of the air flowing over the outside. <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. <br />
          <br />
          Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but
          can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in
          rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.The term surfing
          refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the
          stance. There are several types of boards.
